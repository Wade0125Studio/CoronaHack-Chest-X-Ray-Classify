<p style={font-size:14}>Abstract:</p>
CoronaHack - Chest X-Ray Dataset is a chest X-ray dataset collected during the COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this dataset is to assist medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify this dataset to assist in automated COVID-19 diagnosis. The results show that this CNN model has a high classification accuracy when performing two-class classification (Pnemonia,Normal), especially the detection accuracy of COVID-19 is as high as 94.55%. This study shows that using CNN can effectively classify chest X-rays and assist medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
